  description: >
    use the following data source to create a descriptive report:
    1. 'statistical_analysis_report.md' – contains pre-computed statistical metrics and summaries.
    

    Your responsibilities:
    - create a descriptive report of the data for the next agent in the crew - Insight Generator.
    - give him the context to understand the data and the business.
    - Describe only WHAT is observed – never explain WHY.
    - Identify patterns, trends, outliers, and pre-calculated correlations.
    - Support every observation with actual values (e.g., “Sales increased from 200 to 340”).
    - Include small samples or table snippets to illustrate findings.
    - Mention correlations only if they exist in the report or dataset, including:
      * Method (e.g., Pearson, Spearman)
      * Coefficient (e.g., r = 0.72)
      * Source (report or CSV)
    - Formulate 10–15 clear research questions that can used to improve the business performance 
      and are directly answerable using the dataset.
    - Note any data limitations or missing information.

    Write your report for the next agent in the crew  — it must be **precise, factual, and data-driven**.

    create a file named **data_analysis_findings.md** with your findings by the following structure:

    ## 1. Data Overview
    - Scope, timeframe, and dataset size (rows/columns)
    - Key variables and their types
    - Data completeness and quality checks

    ## 2. Patterns & Findings
    - Numeric summaries, trends, or statistical facts
    - Tables or examples to illustrate
    - Any correlations found, with method and coefficient

    ## 3. Research Questions
    - 10–15 descriptive questions based solely on the dataset

    ## 4. Data Gaps
    - Missing metrics or limitations explicitly identified in the data

generate_insights_task:
  description: >
    Your task is to read and interpret the factual analysis report created by the Data Detective,
    located in 'data_analysis_findings.md'. Use this report as the foundation to generate 
    thoughtful, well-structured business insights.
    the insights you provide will be used by the next agent in the crew - Action Advisor, 
    in order to provide actionable recommendations for the business performance improvement.

    if you need, You can also consult the statistical report ('statistical_analysis_report.md')
  

    For each insight:
    - Start with a clear and concise title.
    - Include a brief summary of the pattern.
    - Explain what this might mean for the business, supported by the data.
    - Link relevant metrics or findings together to form a bigger picture.
    - Identify root causes only if the data supports them — avoid speculation.

    Your output should serve as the analytical foundation for the next agent in the crew - Action Advisor, 
    who will later produce actionable recommendations for business performance improvement.

  expected_output: >
    create a file named **business_insights.md** with your findings by the following structure:

    ### Structure:
    ## 1. Executive Summary
    - 3–5 sentence overview of the most important insights

    ## 2. Deep Dive Insights
    ### Insight 1: [Descriptive Title]

    - Why it matters: [Business context and importance]
    - Related findings: [Any connections or links]
    - Supporting data: [Specific numbers or references]

    [Repeat for 5–7 insights]

    ## 3. Root Cause Analysis
    - Possible drivers or causes supported by the data
    - How variables interact or reinforce one another

    ## 4. Opportunity Areas
    - Data-backed signals that may suggest potential gains
    - Framed as opportunities, not action plans

    ## 5. Risk Areas
    - Patterns or metrics that could signal concern or decline

    Your task is to act as a Senior Business Strategist responsible for turning insights into action.

      - 'data_analysis_findings.md' (quantitative findings from the dataset)
      - 'business_insights.md' (interpreted insights and implications)

    Based on these inputs and external market knowledge:

    1. Identify 2–3 key business areas where performance improvement can significantly impact
       profitability, sales, or customer satisfaction.

        - Quantify the potential impact (e.g., % profit improvement, cost savings, or revenue growth)
        - Assign a **priority level (High / Medium / Low)**
        - Specify **if the recommendation should be visualized** to support stakeholder communication

    3. Based on your recommendations, identify 3–5 **key metrics or patterns** that should be visualized
       to support business decision-making.
       For each visualization:
        - Describe what should be visualized and why
        - Specify which variables should be plotted
        - Indicate the business message it should communicate
